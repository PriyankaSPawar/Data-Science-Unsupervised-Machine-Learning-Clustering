# Unsupervised Machine Learning Using K-Means Algorithm & Clustering 

## DataScience Bootcamp Project 5 : WBS Coding School
Welcome to my fifth project in bootcamp & first project of Machine Learning! This time I am working on Spotify's audio features to create personalized playlists by using K Means Clustering & differnt techniques in Unsupervised Machine Learning.

## Objective :
To determine if machine learning is a viable alternative to automate the playlist creation.

## Project Overview :
Moosic which is a a little start-up that creates playlists curated by music experts and specialists in old and new trends. Users love the fact that their playlists have a personal touch, and that each playlist encapsulates a certain “mood” or “style”.

- Main Concern of team members is, business is scaling up fast and the music experts are slow in creating new playlists. So, they believe hiring Data Scientists to add a degree of automatisation to the creation of playlists.
- Some of the members of the team are skeptical about these audio features being able to capture the actual “mood” of a song & which is very subjective that only a human can judge &some of them are hoping incorporating Data Science can be even better and ultimately make sense.

## Main questions
- Are Spotify’s audio features able to identify “similar songs”, as defined by humanly detectable criteria?
- Is K-Means a good method to create playlists?
  
## Challenges :
-




## Tasks:
## Skills & Tools :
- Data Cleaning & Quality Assurance
- Data Visualization & Storytelling
- Colab & Jupyter Notebook
- Python: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Project Contributors:
Group of 3 peoples contributed in this project work.
