# Unsupervised Machine Learning Using K-Means Algorithm & Clustering 

## DataScience Bootcamp Project 5 : WBS Coding School
Welcome to my fifth project in bootcamp & first project of Machine Learning! This time I am working on Spotify's audio features to create personalized playlists by using K Means Clustering & differnt techniques in Unsupervised Machine Learning.

## Objective :
To determine if machine learning is a viable alternative to automate the playlist creation.

## Project Overview :
Moosic which is a a little start-up that creates playlists curated by music experts and specialists in old and new trends. Users love the fact that their playlists have a personal touch, and that each playlist encapsulates a certain “mood” or “style”.

- Main Concern of team members is, business is scaling up fast and the music experts are slow in creating new playlists. So, they believe hiring Data Scientists to add a degree of automatisation to the creation of playlists.
- Some of the members of the team are skeptical about these audio features being able to capture the actual “mood” of a song & which is very subjective that only a human can judge &some of them are hoping incorporating Data Science can be even better and ultimately make sense.

## Project Contributors:
Group of 3 peoples contributed in this project work.

## Main questions
- Are Spotify’s audio features able to identify “similar songs”, as defined by humanly detectable criteria?
- Is K-Means a good method to create playlists?
  
## Challenges :
- Clustering of more than 5000 songs.
- Large no. of clusters.
- Difficult to pass on the results without listening to songs of each playlists.
- Define the playlist based on the features of the songs.

## Tasks:
- Import the data of all songs from Spotify API to Jupyter Notebook.
- Apply Scaling then define the no. of clusters by applying K-Means algorithm.
- If no. of clusters are large then apply reclustering to divide the clusters in subclusters.
- After reclustering export the playlist & store it in a variable.
- At last listen to some of the songs from it to verify that reclustering works properly.
- Assign name to newly created playlist.

## Important Features of this Project :
- Collection,Evaluation of Database
- Perform Data Cleaning
- K-Means Clustering
- Elbow Method to decide optimal no. of clusters(K)
- Cluster examination to evaluate the characteristics of each cluster
- Reclustering
- Final evaluation of clusters to form the playlists
  
## Skills & Tools :
- Data Cleaning & Quality Assurance
- Data Visualization & Storytelling
- Colab & Jupyter Notebook
- Python: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Deliverables : 
- PowerPoint Presentation.
- Work notebooks in Jupyter Lab.

## Conclusion & Recommendations :
Conclusion:

K-Means method can provide insights into the patterns and characteristics of the music, however it is not creating comprehensive playlists and human involvement is still needed.

Recommendations:
1. Add some contextual features like Release Year and Genres to enhance pattern detection.
2. Improve the result by Re-clustering, Calculating centroids and the distances, Increasing the number of clusters.
3. Explore alternative clustering methods.
